CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

The front-end development used Express HTML to serve the customer-facing web page from the server, and the administration web page utilized Angular for the single-page application. The back end used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it does not require a fixed schema, which allows it to scale better and store different forms of data. JSON is different from JavaScript because it is JavaScript object notation which is a format for easy communication between the front and back end. JSON ties together the front-end and back-end development pieces because the front-end receives JSON data from the back-end API for work. One instance in the full stack process when I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies was when building HTML templates to create reusable user interface components. One benefit of this is it reduces the duplication of code. API testing of endpoints was done using Postman to ensure that GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE returned the proper information.
Furthermore, authentication and authorization were used to ensure all endpoints were properly secured. One way this course helped me in my professional goals is it taught me how each part of an application works together. One skill that I have learned in this course that will help me become a more marketable candidate in my career field is front-end development using frameworks like Angular.
